omnifactory.quest.db.4.title=Iron Supply
omnifactory.quest.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Omnifactory§f exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§f'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. The §aScanner§f in vousr inventory can detect any ore avecin 16 blocks of vous, so digging down and scanning should show vous any nearby veins. Try scanning now by holding §6right-click§f until the progress meter completes.%n%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, vous are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, the quest book will later guide vous towards making a §aFlux Capacitor§f to charge tools in vousr inventory.%n%nIn order to proceed, vous'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§f. vous have a few options. §6Magnetite§f veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§f and §6Gold§f. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§f veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§f can be found paired avec §6Copper§f in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron a second time§f. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert vousr entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§f. The two materials are not interchangable and vous'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

If vous cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§f and §6Rock Salt§f, which might be enough to hold vous over until vous find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§f: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§f is just a less pure and less effective form of Coal.%n%n§6Gold§f: Found inside of §6Magnetite§f veins, close to the surface.

omnifactory.quest.db.9.title=Ore Doubling?
omnifactory.quest.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, vous want to try to process as little ore as possible before vous get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§evous shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Omnifactory, though§f. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast avec §aMining Hammers§f. What's more, even once vous get access to §3Macerators§f, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials or anything vous buy avec §dOmnicoins §fbecause vous can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, vous shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores avecout doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until vous have Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

omnifactory.quest.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§f" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as vousr first substrate.%n%nvous'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§f, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Worktable§r... vous'll be making a LOT of these things.

# db 12
omnifactory.quest.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
omnifactory.quest.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack vous'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§f will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool avec every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§f. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§f... vous cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a "§6Darmstadtium§f" tool (or sometimes §6Aluminium§f) of the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. So just ignore the tool's material in the recipes, it can be whatever vous'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind vous... six ingots, not five). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§f. §6Plates§f can make a §aFile§f, Files can make §6Rods§f, etc. Use JEI to work vousr way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is probably vousr best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as vous progress.

# db 13

Use §3Worktables§f to save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. If vous're doing things right, vous'll likely have §ea dozen or more worktables§f in short order.%n%nLoad up the table's storage area avec the necessary materials, and §ebatch-craft§f items when needed. The satisfaction of clicking a few buttons and getting §ea stack of finished items§f crafted up is worth the effort.%n%nEach worktable will remember up to the last nine recipes vous made in them, which can be recalled by clicking in the top-right recipe history pane. If vous want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, right-click it in the history pane to lock it.

# db 398
omnifactory.quest.db.398.title=Multi Smelter
omnifactory.quest.db.398.desc=The §3Multi Smelter§r is an absolute smelting unit, and is most likely the best furnace added by a mod.%n%nIt's a 3x3x3 multiblock machine capable of §esmelting huge amounts of items per second§r. By upgrading its coils and power tier, it can become capable of smelting up to literal thousands of items per second.%n%nHover over different coil blocks: the higher the §elevel§r, the more items a Multi Smelter can smelt per operation: §e16 items per level§r. The most basic Multi Smelter essentially does 16 items in the same time as a furnace does one. avec a set of level 4 coil blocks, that jumps to 64 items per operation.%n%nThis quest doesn't ask for coils, hatches or buses: feel free to choose whatever combination vous want. vous'll need §a8 coil blocks§r, §a1 input bus§r, §a1 output bus§r and at least §a1 energy hatch§r of any tier.%n%n

# db 399
omnifactory.quest.db.399.title=Plasma Turbine
omnifactory.quest.db.399.desc=§3Large Plasma Turbines§r are a powerful late game method of generating power. One Large Plasma Turbine can produce nearly 41800 EU/t when using an §aLuV Rotor Holder§r and equipped avec §a100% efficiency§r rotor.%n%nOne §3Mark 1 Fusion Reactor§r dedicated to producing §bOxygen Plasma§r can provide suffient fuel for continuously operating 16 Large Plasma Turbines, resulting in a combined production of roughly 670000 EU/t. Granted, this is a decent amount of infrastructure.%n%nDon't rely on §bJEI§r too much when looking for the best plasma: fuels are displayed in a very misleading manner. A Large Plasma Turbine consumes up to nearly 16 buckets of plasma to run a cycle for the duration specified in JEI, and takes some time to spin up to full power.

# db 400
omnifactory.quest.db.400.title=I Don't Like Space
omnifactory.quest.db.400.desc=Space exploration isn't mandatory in this pack, so if vous don't feel like exploring space avec §bAdvanced Rocketry§r, then vous can centrifuge §9Hydrogen§r for §eDeuterium§r instead.%n%nJust keep in mind that it's much less rewarding to skip this and vous'll need lots of Hydrogen to compensate, although vous won't need too much for the first §3Microverse Projector§r.

# db 401
omnifactory.quest.db.401.title=Proper Tool Care
omnifactory.quest.db.401.desc=§3Anvils§f can be used to repair §bGregTech tools§f!%n%nvous might want to get vousrself an anvil instead of breaking and crafting new tools every time. Anvils§f spawn abundantly in §bLost Cities§f buildings, so go and snatch one!%n%nPut a damaged tool inside and put some material it's made of. For example, vous'll need to put §6Wrought Iron Ingots§f to repair tools made of §6Wrought Iron§f.

# db 402
omnifactory.quest.db.402.title=Machine Covers
omnifactory.quest.db.402.desc=GregTech adds a very versatile way of augmenting machines avec §aMachine Covers§r. Covers are "upgrades" that vous can put on any GregTech machine, chest, or drum to expand its functionality. To work avec covers, vous'll need to make vousrself a §aScrewdriver§r to configure covers, and a §aCrowbar§r to remove covers avecout having to break the machine.%n%nHere's a quick list of what covers there are in the game, and what they do:%n%n- §a§lFilter§r: controls what items can enter or leave through a particular side, avec 9 configurable slots and whitelist/blacklist modes. vous can also put a filter into a §aConveyor§r or §aRobotic Arm§r to customize what items they will move. There's also a §9Fluid§r variant of the filter, which offers the same controls and can be placed in §aPumps§f.%n%n- §a§lOre Dictionary Filter§r: a specialized filter that uses ore dictionary entries and supports "*" as a wildcard, e. g. "§6ingotHot*§r" will match all hot ingots, and "§6dustTiny*§r" will match all tiny piles.%n%n- §a§lConveyor§r: transfers items to or from an adjacent inventory.%n%n- §a§lRobotic Arm§r: is much like §aConveyor§r, but has two additional modes: §6Keep Exact§r, which keeps the exact amount of items in the inventory, and §6Supply Exact§r which transfers the exact amount of items per operation (useful for packaging tiny piles when used avec §aOre Dictionary Filter§f!). This cover is very useful for crafting automation.%n%n- §a§lPump§r: is much like a §aConveyor§f, but for fluids.%n%n- §a§lShutter§r: prevents any interactions avec a side.%n%n- §a§lMachine Controller§r: enables or disables a machine and/or its covers depending on whether it is receiving a redstone signal. Useful when paired avec §6ME level emitters§f to keep resources in stock.

# db 403
omnifactory.quest.db.403.title=Screwdrive Output Sides!
omnifactory.quest.db.403.desc=All GregTech machines have one dedicated output side, which can be set by right-clicking a side avec a §aGregTech Wrench§f. This is used for ejecting items into an adjacent inventory.%n%nTo enable auto-output, open the machine GUI and click one of the buttons in the bottom-left corner: §6orange§r is items and §9blue§r is fluids.%n%nIf vous want to also be able to insert items into the output side, vous'll have to right-click the output side avec a §aGregTech Screwdriver§r.%n%nThese features can be used to chain machines together to make processing pipelines and facilitate crafting automation avec §bApplied Energistics 2§f.

# db 404

omnifactory.quest.db.404.desc=vous can easily automate most §bGregTech§r machines avec §aME Interfaces§r and processing §aPatterns§r early on by using the machines's auto-output feature.%n%nUse a §aGregTech Wrench§r to relocate the output side of a machine where vous want it to be, right-click it avec a §aGregTech Screwdriver§r to permit input on the output face, then put an ME Interface on that side of the machine.%n%nRight-click the machine and enable item auto-output (§6orange box§r in the bottom-left corner of the GUI).%n%nNow, stuff the ME Interface avec processing patterns. The next time vous order an item, the ME Interface will push ingredients into the machine, and the machine will push outputs back into the Interface once they're ready, completing the craft. No need to use conduits or import buses!

# db 405

While it is possible to use §6Automation Interfaces§r for this task, vous have access to something §nvastly§r better§r: §bPackagedExCrafting§r.%n%nTo begin, vous'll need to craft one of each extended §3Package Crafter§r listed on the right. Put an §3Unpackager§r on top of each one, and then a §3Packager§r on top of each Unpackager. These are all AE2 devices, so vous'll need to connect them to an ME Network.%n%nNext, right-click the §3Package Recipe Encoder§r, and vous should see a button saying "Processing": this button cycles through recipe types, including the various Extended Crafting tables. vous'll have to choose the appropriate table for the recipe vous want to encode.%n%n§6Holders§r must be encoded in pairs: one for the Packager, and one for the Unpackager. Select the appropriate table for the recipe, look up the recipe vous want to encode, and press §6[+]§r in §bJEI§r to fill it in. Put two Holders in the top-left slot and press Save to encode the recipe to both of them. Finally, put each Holder into the respective machines.%n%nIf vous've done everything correctly, vous should see the item appear as craftable in a Terminal.%n%nWhile it might seem that the crafting process is slow, §ePackagedAuto is excellent at parallelizing§r. vous can surround an Unpackager avec Crafters and it will use all of them. It's also possible to add more Unpackagers avec Crafters to keep up avec the Packager, as long as the Holders are all the same.%n%n

# db 407
omnifactory.quest.db.407.title=Medium Microverse Projector
omnifactory.quest.db.407.desc=The §3Medium Microverse Projector§r is a more powerful projector required for sending Tier Four through Tier Six Micro Miners into microverses.%n%nWhile some of the miners run on IV power, make a §6LuV Energy Input§r so vous don't have to replace it later or accidentally try to run a Tier Six on IV power. Always check the voltage required on a recipe, as vous will §close a miner§r if vous can't supply enough power to complete the mission; ModMachines will continue to eat incoming power avecout making progress.%n%nWhen building the multiblock, be sure to place the §6Quantum Compressors§r to face the same direction as the controller block (this is the usual reason for the structure not forming).

# db 408
omnifactory.quest.db.408.title=PackagedAuto
omnifactory.quest.db.408.desc=§bPackagedAuto§r is an addon for §bApplied Energistics 2§r. Its main purpose in §5Omnifactory§r is to allow vous to automate extended crafting recipes.%n%nApplied Energistics 2 stores recipes in §aPatterns§r, but they are limited to at most 9 stacks of items (a standard 3x3 crafting grid). PackagedAuto stores recipes in §aPackage Recipe Holders§r, which don't have this limitation. Additionally, each Holder can store up to §e20 different recipes§r. Holders must be encoded in the §3Package Recipe Encoder§r.%n%nIn the vast majority of situations vous'll need two identically-encoded Holders, as the following machines work together.%n%nThe §3Packager§r is a machine that compresses ingredients for a specific recipe into a set of §6Recipe Packages§r. Each package in a set can hold up to 9 stacks of ingredient items. A simple recipe might consist of one package, but a complex recipe can have up to 9 packages in its set (for 81 total item stacks).%n%nThe §3Unpackager§r is a machine that extracts ingredient items from complete sets of Recipe Packages made in a Packager, ejecting the items into an adjacent inventory. It will only extract the items if §eall packages in a set are present§r.%n%nWhen both a Packager and Unpackager are connected to an ME Network and have the same recipe, the resulting item will appear as craftable in vousr §aTerminal§r.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.546.desc=Note: this quest accepts both LV and MV Distillery.%n%nIf vous don't feel up to making a §3Distillation Tower§r just yet, vous can get §9Ethanol§r via a single block §3Distillery§r, a machine that gets one fluid and §cvoids the rest§r (in this case, Water). This defers the tower for a little while longer.%n%nHowever, the Distillation Tower is mandatory for advanced chemistry, as most things have more than one important output: §9Fermented Biomass§r, §9Charcoal Byproducts§r from vousr §3Pyrolyse Oven§r, and the entire line of petrochemicals from §9Oil§r, to name a few.%n%nCan't avoid it forever!%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.547.title=Scanner Module: Block
omnifactory.quest.db.547.desc=A good way to find a specific ore vous're missing is the §6Scanner Module: Block§r for vousr Scanner. §6Sneak-right click§f a piece of ore vous want to search for avec a Module in vousr hand, then §6sneak-right click§f the §aScanner§f, put the module inside, and go wander around scanning. %n%nThe range is significantly longer than it is when using the modules which detect all ores, and vous even have room for a second §6Range Module§f if vous've got an §6Ender Pearl§f to craft one.%n%nvous can combo this avec ores bought from §dOmnicoins§f to act as a "sample" to easily find a full vein avec the Block Module.

# db 548
omnifactory.quest.db.548.title=Molds
omnifactory.quest.db.548.desc=§aMolds§r are used in a §3Fluid Solidifier§r or §3Alloy Smelter§r to form materials into specific shapes. These are not consumed or damaged during crafting, so vous can leave them in a machine to dedicate it to that shape.%n%nThe Fluid Solidifier tends to be the more efficient option: for example, vous can use §e8 ingots§r to make one §6Gear§r in an Alloy Smelter, but avec a Fluid Extractor and Solidifier vous can accomplish the same result avec §e4 ingots§r.%n%nBe careful not to accidentally make §aExtruder Shapes§r. Those are for a machine vous will get access to later. The two molds in this quest are ones vous will find useful right away.

omnifactory.quest.db.549.desc=If vous don't like the idea of mining out Oilsands veins, vous can build an §3Oil Drilling Rig§r.%n%nvous'll need to provide it avec power, §9Drilling Fluid§r, and a steady supply of §6Pipes§r. The Pipes only have a 1% chance to have one be used up per bucket of §9Oil§r drilled.

# db 550
omnifactory.quest.db.550.title=Vertical Digger
omnifactory.quest.db.550.desc=Place the §3Vertical Digger§r over an ore vein, feed it RF, and it will mine up the entire vein for vous.%n%nFor drills, vous will need a §6GregTech Drill§r (any LV drill will work), a §6Fluxbore§r (Reinforced tier is required) and an §6Actually Additions Drill§r (any color is fine, but take out any augments vous wish to keep).%n%nThe GregTech Drill will not be consumed, but everything else will be.

# db 551
omnifactory.quest.db.551.title=Phantom Booster
omnifactory.quest.db.551.desc=Up to three §aPhantom Boosters§r can be placed atop the §3Vertical Digger§r to increase its area of effect.%n%nThese are also useful for extending the range of other "Phantom" machines and devices from §bActually Additions§r.

omnifactory.quest.db.552.desc=Being able to fly is pretty sick.

omnifactory.quest.db.556.desc=Now that vous have a §3Wiremill§f and a §3Compressor§f, vous can consider starting to do §eBounties§f. The §6Bounty Board§f has a global inventory containing quests to turn in specific items in exchange for §dOmnicoins§f. These quests have a fairly short duration, so make sure to §estockpile the items§f that come up on them or else they'll §cexpire before vous can complete them§f.%n%navec renewable §dOmnicoins§f, vous should feel free to spend the ones vous have on whatever vous need. §aSpend vousr coins!

omnifactory.quest.db.558.title=Fuel Catalyzers
omnifactory.quest.db.558.desc=This is an augment that will work in all §3dynamos§f. It increases the efficiency of the fuel being used inside the dynamo, increasing the power it generates. However, the rate of power generation remains the same, the fuel simply lasts longer. So while §6Fuel Catalyzers§f decrease the amount vous'll need to go mining for §6Coal§f, they won't boost vousr production of RF per second.%n%nEach Fuel Catalyzer increases fuel efficiency by §a15%§f, additively (so two will make fuel last §a30% longer§f, three is §a45% longer§f, etc).

# db 559
omnifactory.quest.db.559.title=Auxiliary Transmission Coils
omnifactory.quest.db.559.desc=The §aAuxiliary Transmission Coil §ris an augment that will work in all types of dynamos. It will consume fuel faster to produce a correspondingly higher RF per tick.%n%nEach augment increases both base power production and fuel consumption by 100%, additively (so the second is 200%, third is 300%, etc).%n%nConsider the tradeoffs however, as vous could just make another dynamo, and vous miss out on §aFuel Catalyzer§r augments that make fuels burn longer for more total RF generated. The Auxiliary Transmission Coil will put additional stress vousr fuel production infrastructure.%n%nIf that's an acceptable tradeoff, then Auxiliary Transmission Coils are a cheap and effective way to boost vousr power production.

A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to vousr ME Network. Whenever vous need some of this fluid, vousr AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches avec this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but vous won't be able to access them. vous will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and vous may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that vous want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen vous get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. vous can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else vous need them.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.746.title=Compactor
omnifactory.quest.db.746.desc=A very power-efficient, if slow before upgrades, means of creating plates. Also the only way to directly make plates from single gems.%n%nUpgrading the machine tier avec §aUpgrade Kits§r and applying §aAugments§r to boost its crafting speed is a good idea.%n%nPlates and Platings that are gated specifically by later §bGregTech§r voltage tiers are not craftable in these (instead requiring a §3Compressor§r), but almost every single-ingredient recipe made in a Compressor is available.

omnifactory.quest.db.747.title=Dark Steel Enchanter
omnifactory.quest.db.747.desc=Vanilla enchanting mechanics are just so tedious. Don't vous wish vous could just make a specific enchant instead of grinding levels and rolling the dice?%n%n§eOh wait- vous can!§r%n%nThe §3Dark Steel Enchanter§r is a device that uses §6Book and Quill§r, experience levels, lapis, and enchant-specific items to create an §6Enchanted Book§r avec an enchantment of vousr choosing. Then vous can just use an Anvil to enchant vousr item like usual.%n%nThis is a good time to bring up the §dHolding§r enchant, which can be applied to most items from §bThermal Foundation§r and its related mods. Holding can be crafted up to level IV, which massively boosts the storage capacity of items like §aSatchels§r, §aFlux Capacitors§r, and §aPortable Tanks§r.%n%nvous can also make the §dMending§r enchant which allows vous to infinitely repair the item when damaged using §9Liquid XP§r in an §bEnderIO §aFluid Tank§r or §aPressurized Fluid Tank§r.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.748.title=Gearworking Die
omnifactory.quest.db.748.desc=A §3Compactor§r§r§r specialized to a §aGear Press§r is a very power efficient way to make gears. It is slower than its overclocking GTCE counterparts, but is required for some gears, most notably the crystal and gemstone ones.%n%nLike all §aAugments§r, the Gear Press specialization takes up an upgrade slot, but vous can still use the rest of the slots for other ones like speed upgrades.

Make an extra 28 if vous don't want more than §a2 Fluid Inputs§r§r and §a1 Fluid Output§r.%n%nIf vous insist on upgrading instead of making a new one, don't dismantle the current one before vous're sure vous've got everything vous need to upgrade it, or vous might end up having to rebuild the §3Mark 1 Fusion Reactor§r again.

omnifactory.quest.db.750.desc=A complex material from §bThermal Expansion§r cooked in an §3Electric Blast Furnace§r.%n%n§6Enderium§r doesn't require much power (running on as little as MV) but it does need a lot of heat and is incredibly slow avecout overclocking.%n%nAs avec all later blast furnace materials, dedicate a furnace to keeping these in stock and have it running constantly to ensure a stable supply (turning it off when vous have an acceptably vast stockpile).

# db 751

omnifactory.quest.db.752.desc=Using plain §3Steam Dynamos§f is pretty inefficient.%n%nIt's strongly recommended to make §aaugments§r. avec these, vous can turn one Steam Dynamo into a §3steam boiler§f, and two other Steam Dynamos into §3steam turbines§f. The ratio is always §a1:2§r if all Dynamos are equally upgraded.%n%nThis greatly increases the overall efficiency and the amount of power produced, from §a40 RF/t§r per basic steam dynamo to §a320 RF/t§r per set of three augmented dynamos.

omnifactory.quest.db.754.desc=Before vous travel to the Moon, vous'll want to set up a way to easily return.%n%nLay out nine of the §6Telepad Blocks§r in a 3x3 pattern. They should turn into a multiblock. While having some §6Paper§r in vousr inventory, use the §aCoordinate Selector§r to create a §6Location Printout§r of an area near the Telepad. Keep track of this Printout and make sure to bring it avec vous to the Moon!%n%nMake sure the Telepad on the Overworld is ready to go. It needs power, a tank of §9Dew of the Void§r, and the chunk it's in needs to be §eChunkloaded§r. Bring the other nine Telepad Blocks avec vous when vous go to the Moon, and once there, set up a similar lavoust. The one on the Moon will also need power, Dew of the Void and its chunk loaded. Consider making a solar panel and a capacitor bank to keep it powered.%n%nOnce vousr Moon Telepad is up and running, put vousr Overworld coordinates into it. Then record vousr current location on the Moon avec the Coordinate Selector. Teleport home, and put those coordinates into the Overworld Telepad. Now vous can travel back and forth easily!%n%nvous might consider building a room dedicated to Telepad transit, both on the Overworld and to other Planets, and label them. vous'll be visiting many other worlds soon enough.

Now, place it inside a Pedestal so vous can travel to the bound spot anytime vous want.%n%nBefore going to the Moon, vous'll need §etwo Dislocators§f and §etwo Pedestals§f.%n%nBind one Dislocator to a location in the Overworld, then take it avec vous to the Moon and put it down on a Pedestal.%n%nBind the other Dislocator to a location on the Moon, then use the first Pedestal to return home.
